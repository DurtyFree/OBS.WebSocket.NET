# OBS.WebSocket.NET
A .NET library wrote in C# to communicate with the [OBS-WebSocket Server](https://github.com/Palakis/obs-websocket) server. 
Depends on [WebSocket4Net](https://github.com/kerryjiang/WebSocket4Net) and [JSON.Net](http://www.newtonsoft.com/json).

This library is available on the [NuGet gallery](https://www.nuget.org/packages/OBS.WebSocket.NET/). See the `TestClient` project for a working example.
